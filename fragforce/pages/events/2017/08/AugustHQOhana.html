Well have we got a thing for you!
 
Thats right folks, during the next Ohana Game Night on August 8th, we will also be having our first CHARITY FRAGFORCE TOURNAMENT!  The CHARITY FRAGFORCE TOURNAMENT is a great way to help out [Extra Life][FFTeam] and [Children's Miracle Network][CMN] to help sick and injured kids in our communities, all while showing everyone just how much better you are at games than everyone else!

Not interested in competing?  That's fine, we will have plenty of people there just playing games of all sorts and just having fun!

Not a Salesforce Employee?  That's fine too!  Go check out the [Meetup][FFMeetup] and join us! Don't worry about the waitlist, we'll take everyone!
