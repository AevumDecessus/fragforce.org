Who's ready for round two of [Fragforce][FF] Herndon? You are! Please join us
for some non-stop gaming action in November at the Salesforce Herndon
office. Once again we are partnering up with [Children's Miracle Network][CMN]
to help sick and injured kids in our communities. We've also teamed up with
[Child's Play][CP], a charity that gives toys and games to children's hospitals
all over the world. Come out and have a great time while making the world a
better place!
