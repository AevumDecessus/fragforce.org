Hello fellow Gamers,

On June 22nd your local FragForce team plans to put together an extra life fundraiser in order to raise $5000 for Doernbecher Childrenâ€™s Hospital. In order to achieve this goal we need your help. Of course you could just donate some money to do your part but why not do more? 
We need individuals to join us on stream and help raise and drive donations. If you enjoy streaming or just looking a way to get time in front of a camera to kick start that acting career you always dreamed of let us know we have plenty of seats open.
