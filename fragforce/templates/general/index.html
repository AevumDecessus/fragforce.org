  <h3>Who we are</h3>
  <p>Fragforce is the global charity gaming team from Salesforce that is raising money to support kids facing scary stuff like social mistreatment and medical issues (i.e. cancer, cystic-fibrosise, accidents, etc). By rallying our friends, family, and co-workers, we are creating/facilitating a new philanthropic tradition to boost employee morale and support cross-team and community collaboration through a shared love of gaming.</p>
  <h3>Who we are supporting</h3>
  <p>Extra Life is a charity organization that is raising money to support Children's Miracle Network (CMN) hospitals across the country. Extra Life helps games to pledge to play games for 24 hours, and to solicit donations from their families and friends for CMN in the process.</p>
  <p>Child's Play is an international charity organization that seeks to improve the lives of children in hospitals and domestic violence shelters through the generosity and kindness of the video game industry and the power of play.</p>
