[Fragforce][FF] is BACK to Dublin - Ireland!!! On the 3rd and 4th of November, we will be organising the next 
big two-day gaming marathon in our Central Park Office. Come and play games while raising money for a charity!
 
Fragforce is a donation based event that helps to raise money for [Childs Play][CPC] by playing games, 
everyone is welcome to join for a minimum donation of € 20.00 in either Cash or Paypal. With your donation, 
we will make sure you'll have a great time and won't starve from hunger, there are snacks and pizza to feed 
you while you game. If you donate more than € 20.00 we will include amazing Fragforce swag for you to take home.
