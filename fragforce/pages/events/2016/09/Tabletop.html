The Salesforce charity gaming team is back and this time we're on the boards -
the boardgame boards!  Please join us for the Herndon team's inaugural
"TableTop Appreciation Weekend" Saturday Sept 17th 2016 from 9am-9pm.  This
event is open to SFDC employees, family and friends (pre-registration required
for guests, please sign up *[HERE:][TTSU]*, so we can get nametags & the like
set up in advance).
￼
We will have all manner of boardgame mayhem available, including individual,
team, and cooperative (players vs the game) games, as well as tournaments,
challenges, raffles and exciting prizes.  And remember, this is #4thekids, we
are supporting both Extra-Life/Children's Miracle Network, in North America,
and Child's Play Charities, globally, to leverage fun and games in order to
help sick kids get well ... I can't think of a better reason to play, can you?
Come on out and join in the fun - you can support your favorite gamer, or join
the team and raise funds yourself!  It's easy, just visit our website and get
signed up.

We look forward to seeing you (and your meeples) on the fields of glorious (and
silly) battle, this Saturday, in Herndon.  The event will be streamed live on
twitch and recorded for future historical documentation purposes (and not at
all for blackmail, no matter what Gary says).

Please join us in a day of irreverent, unabashed fun for this very noble cause!
