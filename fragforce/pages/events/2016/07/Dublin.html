Get excited for the first ever international [Fragforce][FF] event taking place in Dublin, Ireland! 
We are working together with [Child's Play Charity][CPC] in order to help raise funds to help 
improve the lives of children in hospitals and domsestic violence shelters throughout the world.

###How Can I Help/Donate?###
All Donations should be made via [http://childsplay.fragforce.org][CPF] which will direct 
to our own org's donation [link][FFCP].
 
If you are taking part please try raise donations from your family, friends or gaming networks (or even yourself) 
as we are aiming for at least $100 raised for the event per individual. We can match donations also.
 
Childsplay can decide the best way to use your donation or you can specify which Children's hospital you'd like 
to donate directly to by commenting in the optional 'leave a comment' section on the donation page. Our local 
National Children's hospital is  "National Children's Hospital Dublin, Tallaght" . If you have any concerns 
or queries on this please emailinfo@childsplaycharity.org, you can also email with your hospital if you 
forget to add the comment during donation.
 
Please include your Participant name or @salesforce.com email address in the comment field.
