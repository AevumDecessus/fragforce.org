The days are counting down until the Fragforce PDX 2017 Extra Life MARATHON GAMING EVENT on October 27th and 28th! It's time to tune up your controllers, fire up your gaming tower, and polish up your polyhedral dice!
 
Get Hyped for 24 HOURS of gaming at Salesforce's Hillsboro office, starting at 5pm on Friday and wrapping up at 5pm on Saturday.
 
 
At this year's event we have, for your gaming enjoyment:
TOURNAMENTS! (Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros, Magic: The Gathering)
Demos from local game developers and Rainy Day Games!
VIRTUAL REALITY!
Bring-Your-Machine LAN Party!
Exclusive Early Access to Brand new Board Games by Local Independent game developers!
 
Badges, lanyards, and custom, unique, hand-painted merit pins for participation and victory!
Opportunities to CHEAT AT GAMES (for charity, of course)!
A LIVE STREAM on Twitch for remote folks to watch and participate with!
The chaos and hilarity of a real life game of HUNGRY HUNGRY HUMANS!
Weird and random craziness like POST-APOCALYPTIC DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION!
Whether you stop in for a few hours Friday evening, sometime Saturday, join us online, or triumphantly conquer the full 24 hours on site, we'd love to have you with us!

We are very proud of the hard work put in by Salesforce employees on Fragforce teams across the country. We're leading the pack but to stay there we need your help!
 
 
BACKGROUND!
Extra Life is an organization that raises funds to support the Children's Miracle Network, which consists of hospitals across the US and Canada. Locally, our Extra Life group (Fragforce PDX) supports OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital.
 
 
 
I'm hoping everyone can take a moment, or a few hours, or a day to support the Fragforce team in our efforts to raise funds for these great institutions and all the good they do for children facing really scary stuff.
