After the success of last year’s Extra Life Gaming Marathon events in the 
Herndon, VA and Portland, OR offices, the Fragforce team, a handful of 
employees from various groups and offices inside Salesforce, are continuing 
fundraising efforts throughout FY17 at various offices throughout the U.S. 
to promote their awesome and geeky idea: 

*“Embrace the inherently philanthropic nature of our tech company, through 
our shared mutual love of video games.”*

To kick off the planned events for FY17, the Fragforce team in Herndon, VA 
coordinated 12-hour gaming events spread out over two days on April 1st and 2nd
to continue their fundraising efforts through the video game charity organization 
[Extra Life](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm) with proceeds going to
children’s hospitals that are part of the 
[Children’s Miracle Network](http://give.childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/).

During the two-day event, almost 60 Salesforce employees (with over 30 guests) 
took over conference rooms throughout the Herndon, VA office and brought desktop 
computers, consoles, and tabletop games. Much of the event was streamed live out 
to the internet via [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/sfdc_fragforce).
