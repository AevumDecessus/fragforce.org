[Fragforce][FF] is proud to announce our first partner event with a 
[Children's Miracle Network][CMN] hospital! We are partnering with
[UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital][UCSF] in order to run a [Fragforce][FF]
event directly on site at the hospital.

This is an amazing recognition and opportunity for us, and we are looking
forward to working closely with [UCSF][UCSF] to make this a bigger and
better thing every year.
